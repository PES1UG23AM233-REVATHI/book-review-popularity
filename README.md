---

## 🔍 Overview
This project predicts whether a **book review** will be **popular** (highly rated) or **not popular**, based solely on its **text content**.  
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, we analyze linguistic patterns — tone, structure, and vocabulary — to estimate engagement levels.  

The project is inspired by the paper:  
**_“Text-Based Prediction of Book Review Popularity”_** by *Bridget Daly, Stanford University.*
